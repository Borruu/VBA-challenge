Module 2 Challenge.

I have created one Subroutine called ticker_03 which will address all components of the homework and bonus challenge. Please see file titled Mod02_VBA_Code.

1. Columns I to L are populated with the values for ticker, yearly change, percent change and total stock volume respectively. 
2. Column J (yearly change) has conditional formatting applied to reflect positive or negative change through interior colour change. Cells with no change will have no interior colour.
3. Number formatting is applied to columns K and L. Headings are added to columns I to L and all columns then have width adjusted.
4. Values for the bonus challenge are found and stored in variables.
5. Bonus challenge values are populated in columns P and Q.
6. Number formatting is applied to relevant cells in column Q.
7. Headings are added to columns O, P and Q.
8. Formatting (bold text and autofit width) are applied to the results.
9. Steps 1 to 8 are then repeated on all worksheets.
